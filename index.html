<p class="lead text-justify">Home Office is chosen coworkers. It is free. It is a fresh perspective in times of frustration.  It is distraction when you need it. It is low-resource.  Home Office is an experiment in cooperative work.</p>

<p>Home office is located at <strong>1314 N. Claremont Ave. Apt 1F in Chicago</strong>. It lives at the border of the Humboldt Park, Wicker Park and Ukranian Village neighborhoods and is a short walk to CTA busses or the Blue Line Damen stop.</p>
